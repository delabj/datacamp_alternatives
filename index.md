# Datacamp Alternatives

## Why This Exsists
Datacamp is at it again. ([well, I say again, but this is really a continuation of what has been going on.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xzn3v/datacamp-ceo-steps-down-after-sexual-misconduct-allegations-prompt-backlash))

Datacamp just announced that they are sueing Rstudio because Rstudio stood with the a former employee who felt they were sexually assulted, and Datacamp see's this as defimation of the company from a competitor. [You can read Datacamps statement here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/rstudio-pending-legal-matter)

Datacamp is claiming to have debunked [an article writen by a reporter at buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup) (now at the NYT covering tech and disinformation) [by conducting an independant 3rd party review ](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/working-ideal-independent-third-party-review-of-datacamp) which found 

- " little factual dispute"
- "not [...] appropriate or advisable"
- "actions were not consistent with key values"
- "made a number of mistakes "
- "did not take sufficient account "

When this first surfaced, Datacamp made a post about the event using a no-index tag, preventing it from appearing in Google Search results. 


## Alternative Resources

In light of the above, I'm compiling a list of resources that can be used instead of Datacamp for learning about data science. These are in no particular order. If possible, I'll try to include a small snippit about what the resource offers.
